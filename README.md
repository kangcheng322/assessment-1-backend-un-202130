# [Template] Fibonacci Series action.

# This work is made to be used in Github Action to run the fibonacci series program.

# To prove it: https://github.com/kangcheng322/assessment-1-backend-un-202130/actions

# For the first case the input is 9, but it can be changed in the main.yml file

# Running Github Action would show the following:
 Input: 9
 Output: 
 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
